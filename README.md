Our term project is a software package for Boolean Algebra and Digital Electronics enthusiasts which will help then solve simple to complex problems instantly. Our software has features which include:

1. Karnaugh-Map (K-Map) Solver for SOP (Sum-Of-Products) and POS (Product-Of-Sum) with Don’t Cares (2-5 variables).
2. Quine-McCuskey (QM) Algorithm for Prime Implicants (PI) and Essential Prime Implicants with Don’t Cares (Any number of variables).
3. Hazard Detector and its Cover (Static 0 and Static 1 hazards).
4. Multiple Output Minimization without Don’t Care (Any number of variables. 2 functions). 
5. Code Conversion between Decimal, Binary, 8421 (BCD), 2421, 5211, Excess-3 (XS-3) and Gray Code.
6. Generating Hamming Code and decoding 1-bit Errors in Transmitted Hamming Code.

This project is done under the guidance of Professor Goutam Saha of IIT Kharagpur.
